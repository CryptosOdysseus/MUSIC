# “AA-L-E DA-O” on the tune of “Live and Let Die”

#

## When you were young and your ledger was an open source
## You used to say hack and let hack
## (You know you did, you know you did, you know you did)
## But if this Automated Autonomous Legal
## Entities get a go

#

# (Chorus)

#

## Say AA-L-E DA-O
## (AA-L-E DA-O)
## AA-L-E DA-O
## (AA-L-E DA-O)

#

# [Strings Solo]

#

## What does it matter to you?
## When you got a hack to do
## You got to do it well
## You got to GitHub and dump Word / Excell

#

## You used to say hack and let hack
## (You know you did, you know you did, you know you did)
## But if this Automated Autonomous Legal
## Entities get a go

#

# (Chorus)

#

## Say AA-L-E DA-O
## (AA-L-E DA-O)
## AA-L-E DA-O
## (AA-L-E DA-O)

#

# [Strings Solo]

#

# [Outro]

## You used to say “Hack and let hack” yeah

#

## [Violin Solo]
