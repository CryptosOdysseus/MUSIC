#### Remark: when it came out, this Pink Floyd song (associated with the movie The Wall) wasn't a statement against education or schools, it was an artistic manifesto about a certain education mindset and school system.
#### Analogously, this parody isn't a statement against regulation or regulatory systems, it is a parodic manifesto about a certain regulation mindset and regulatory approach.
